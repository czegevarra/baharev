I have been actively writing documentation since 2019, bringing my expertise in translation and journalism to this field. Despite graduating as a surveyor, my professional journey has led me to work in diverse industries such as IoT, logistics, cryptocurrency, and cybersecurity. Adaptability is one of my strengths, allowing me to quickly grasp new domains.&#x20;

My personal background includes electronics, music, and gasoline engines (surprisingly). My passion for technical writing was sparked by the book "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance." In terms of technical skills, I am well-versed in static site generators and embrace the "docs as code" approach.&#x20;

Currently, I am working on implementing Antora. Additionally, I have experience creating interface texts, including tooltips and error messages. When it comes to tools, I am familiar with various platforms such as Atlassian, Miro, and WYSIWYG documentation tools like Readme.com and Gitbook. I am also proficient in Git, pandoc, and Visual Studio Code. Basically familiar with Linux and terminal commands.&#x20;
